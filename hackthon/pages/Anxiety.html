        </h1>
        <p>
            Anxiety is your body’s natural response to stress. It’s a feeling of fear or apprehension about what’s to come. For example, going to a job interview or giving a speech on the first day of school may cause some people to feel fearful and nervous.<break></p>
                <h4>What are the types of anxiety disorders?
                </h4>
